And it seems to be just another winter. The weather is cold, there are lots of cloudy days, and the city has this kind of typical tango sadness.</h2>

<p>Yes, it seems to be just another regular winter at Buenos Aires. But something strange is happening. Something that has never happended before. No one, even the oldest of persons here, remembers something like this.</p>

<p>At the Palermo neighborhood there is a Garden of Roses. Locals name it "El Rosedal". And there, all of the 18000 roses have closed themselves. They don't show their petals and faces anymore. So, we've sent one of our reporters there to see if he could talk with them, and get them to tell him why they did so. This is what he got.</p>

<p>At the first sight, they looked all the same. Just a lot of roses that closes themselves to the world, without explanation. But, after having talk with them, I've found out there were to different groups between them, that closed because of different reasons. The roses from the first group are mad, angry about something. The roses from the second group seem to be sad because of something. So, these are their reasons:</p>

<p>From the first group of roses:</p>

<p>Rose: We're on strike - said the rose, with an angry face -. Oh yes sir, we're on strike, and we are not going to stop it until the city's major listen to us.</p>

<p>Reporter: But, why are you on strike? What do you expect the major to do? What's the issue?</p>

<p>Rose (looking at the reporter with a look as saying "int's it obvious?"): Well, I think I have to tell you the whole story. So, here I go. It happened a couple of months ago, it was a sunny sunday, lots of people were here, looking our beauty, admiring us. But then, this lady came, this beautiful, blonde hair, blue eyes young lady, how did she dared? Her beauty overshadowed us! Suddenly, people stopped looking at us just to look at her! (The rose rised a finger up) And we are not going to allow that anymore! How can it be? It is just not fair. Gardeners here work a lot on us to keep us pretty, it's a lot of work, but she, she just has it naturally! She doesn't needs to work on that! So, we're on strike until the major bans her from getting into our garden again!</p>

<p>From the secound group of roses, I had this different answer:</p>

<p>Rose (she slowly opens herself after I asked her gently a couple of times if I could ask talk with here. She has sorrow in her face): Hi... yes, we closed ourselves. We don't want the world to see us like this. Yes, we're sad. Why, do you ask? Well, it happened a couple of months ago. We were just so happy about us, about who we are, about our beautiness... we used to think we were the most beautiful thing in the world. You know, people from all around the world comes to our city, and they came here to see us and all of them said we're beautiful, and we were happy... but then, she came. This beautiful young lady, she's blond hair and blue eyes, and her hair shined very beautiful with the sunlight... We, the ones that were proud about our beauty, we just saw her, and she overshadowed all of us, and we admired her beauty, she was almost mesmerizing to us. And then, then.. she left. And she has never come back... and we miss her beauty... that's why.. we closed ourselves. We want her to come back to visit us. That would make us so happy... but until then... we just don't feel like. And now I will close myself again sir. I just don't want to... sorry. Goodbye.</p>

<p>So, it seems as a irreconcilable difference. Half of the roses want she to banned from entering their garden; the other half wants she to come back. And we keep asking ourselves, who is she?</p>
